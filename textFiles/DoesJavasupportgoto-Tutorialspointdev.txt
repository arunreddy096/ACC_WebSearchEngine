Java does not support goto, it is reserved as a keyword just in case they wanted to add it to a later version. Unlike C/C++, Java does not have goto statement, but java supports label. The only place where a label is useful in Java is right before nested loop statements. We can specify label name with break to break out a specific outer loop. Similarly, label name can be specified with continue. Using break with label in Java // Java code to illustrate // using label and break // instead of goto // file name: Main.java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // label for outer loop outer: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { if (j == 1) break outer; System.out.println(" value of j = " + j); } } // end of outer loop } // end of main() } // end of class Main Output: value of j = 0 Using continue with label in Java We can also use continue instead of break. See following program for example. // Java code to illustrate // using label and continue // instead of goto // file name: Main.java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // label for outer loop outer: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { if (j == 1) continue outer; System.out.println(" value of j = " + j); } } // end of outer loop } // end of main() } // end of class Main /div> Output: value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0 Explanation : Since continue statement skips to the next iteration in the loop, it iterates for 10 times as i iterates from 0 to 9. So the outer loop executes for 10 times and the inner for loop executes 1 time in each of the outer loop.

Java does not support goto, it is reserved as a keyword just in case they wanted to add it to a later version. Unlike C/C++, Java does not have goto statement, but java supports label. The only place where a label is useful in Java is right before nested loop statements. We can specify label name with break to break out a specific outer loop. Similarly, label name can be specified with continue. Using break with label in Java // Java code to illustrate // using label and break // instead of goto // file name: Main.java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // label for outer loop outer: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { if (j == 1) break outer; System.out.println(" value of j = " + j); } } // end of outer loop } // end of main() } // end of class Main Output: value of j = 0 Using continue with label in Java We can also use continue instead of break. See following program for example. // Java code to illustrate // using label and continue // instead of goto // file name: Main.java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // label for outer loop outer: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { if (j == 1) continue outer; System.out.println(" value of j = " + j); } } // end of outer loop } // end of main() } // end of class Main /div> Output: value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0
value of j = 0 Explanation : Since continue statement skips to the next iteration in the loop, it iterates for 10 times as i iterates from 0 to 9. So the outer loop executes for 10 times and the inner for loop executes 1 time in each of the outer loop.
